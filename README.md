# DirectoryScanner

#### A programme that allows the user to see file changes since a given date.

---

On start, you need to select a directory path and a location for logs to be saved in. If you do not have defaults set up for this (in the settings tab), you will be asked if you would like to set the current paths as the default.

By default, the programme will check for any changes after the date it was last run. If the programme has not been run before, then then the Date will be set to the minumum possible value. The user can change this by unchecking the box and selecting their own date.

In the settings tab, you can set up the email settings and if these are set then an email will be sent on completion.
